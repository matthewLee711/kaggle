    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The American Community dataset is a survey conducted by the US Census Bureau in 2013 to provide reasearchers information about the US population. Laws and policies are developed to benefit the majority of citizens within the United States. Since developing policies require not only a very extensive amount of time and money to create (especially if it is not well recieved), decisions need to be made with upmost accuracy based on both seen and unseen trends. The consolidation of this information helps\n",

    "### Data Info and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, there are 283 attributes for over 1.6 million rows (people surveyed); actually it is about 6.4 million if you consider there are four files. The objective of this analysis is to provide a good understanding of how much financial success Americans are having in the United States and determine whether or not more philanthropic policies should be geared towards them. Secondly, legal and illegal immigrants are a large discussion within current politics. Since there is a limited amount of funds that can be enacted toward policies, the second objective is to figure out whether lower income or immigrants deserve priority in terms of politics. For example, should policies towards the health care system or social security favor immigrants who are or are not citizens, yet show successful integration into society? These are the questions this analyses is looking to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Success of Immigrants \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of being born an American citizen allows that person to be directly integrated into society, thus allowing that person to understand social norms. Immigrants on the other hand, once they arrive in the United States, they have to integrate into society, which inheritantly gives them a slight disadvantage in terms of being able to compete for schools and job positions. In a sense, if an immigrant is able to successfully land into a good college, yet do not have the funds to go to the school, do they deserve to have priority in earning FAFSA money over an American born citizen? Success is a hard word to define, but the main analysis will use financial income as a determinant of success. The reasoning behind it is because jobs that have a high salary not only means the job is hard obtain, but the person has a higher ability at influencing the economy through his or her purchasing power. A country's gdp-to-citizen results in higher quality of life. In other words, a high circulation of money within an economy will boost quality of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing whether to fund an immigrant or US citizen for college on the basis of who will have the greatest impact to the US is a hard choice, but it can be inspected through analysis of the data provided by the US bureau. The ultimate goal is to figure out if the US government should focus on creating politics that are geared more beneficial towards immigrants with a high potential or US citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the American populace is important to allow policy makers to create meaningful laws which will impact the US population the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Grade and Worth\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to figure out the potential of an immigrant or US citizen based on anonymous surveys, the most important value will be based on immigrant's and income after graduating college or currently in the work force. There are a lot values which can determine the success of a immigrant from one country in comparison to an immigrant from another country. Of course, there are variables which contribute to financial success, in which they will be examined. Considering the size of the dataset and 283 attributes, there is bound to be a correlation. The best way to value if a learning algorithm works is by seeing how correct the algorithm is in guessing the success of a person based on given inputs."
